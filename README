I spent too much time figuring out what chat app to use but telegram is the best. I got commands working though
that I can send from my phone to the bot. Lines 27-43 are what I believe is the functionality we should have for the bot.
If you can think of anything you would like to be ale to control just add a new commented out function name beneath mine
and a comment if the name isnt obvious.

Im gonna turn the telegram bot into a class the next time im free and it will instantiate your binanceReader and be
the main controller.
